## 1. Introduction

The following is a case study on potential growth avenues in the wearables market, focusing on a single company: Bellabeat.

Bellabeat is a wearable tech company focusing on women's wellness. In this study, I will be taking a deep-dive into a 2016 Fitbit dataset to identify smart device usage, and potential marketing solutions for future business success. 

A major point of focus will be Bellabeat's newest wearable: the Ivy fitness tracker. At $250, this wearable offers a more premium experience over previous offerings like the Leaf and Time, and also features a more tracking features such as heart rate, respiratory rate, wellness scores, hydration, sleep, cycles and mindfulness.

## 2. Ask

### 2.1 Business Task
The founder of Bellabeat, Urška Sršen, would like the marketing analytics team to analyze existing data on fitness wearable use to inform future marketing strategy. The core question is as follows:

**What are trends in smart device usage, how would this information apply to Bellabeat customers, and how could this inform the company's marketing strategy?**

## 3. Prepare

### 3.1 Data Source Used:
For this question, we will be using the dataset ["Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) uploaded by the user Möbius under the CC0: Public Domain license. For the purposes of this study, we chose to focus on four tables: daily steps, activity, sleep, and intensity. This information will allow us to see potential areas of growth.

### 3.2 Loading packages
The data was downloaded into a folder titled "bellabeat_casestudy_20220527" for easy access. Working in R, we installed *dplyr*, *janitor*, and *tidyverse* for additional cleaning and filtering functions:

```{r loading packages}
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

The files were then added to the environment:

```{r adding files}
daily_activity <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
daily_steps <- read.csv("dailySteps_merged.csv")
daily_intensities <- read.csv("dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
daily_sleep <- read.csv("sleepDay_merged.csv")
```

Duplicate rows were removed from daily_sleep:

```{r remove duplicates}
daily_sleep <- distinct(daily_sleep)
```


### 3.3 Data Assessment
This data set was generated by a distributed survey running from March 12th, 2016 to May 12th, 2016. Responses were gathered as activity data from personal fitness trackers. By counting the number of unique user IDs from each of the tables, we found that there were 33 users, although only 24 took part in the sleep study:

```{r finding the step count for daily steps, activity, intensities, and sleep}
print(paste("Users in daily steps: ",length(unique(daily_steps$Id))))
print(paste("Users in daily activity: ", length(unique(daily_activity$Id))))
print(paste("Users in daily intensities: ",length(unique(daily_intensities$Id))))
print(paste("Users in daily sleep: ",length(unique(daily_sleep$Id))))
```
Additionally, a count is taken of the days covered in the data sets, to discover that this data takes place over the period from April 12th, 2016 to May 12th, 2016. The period from March 12th to April 11th is captured in a separate data set found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/53894#.YdMLrRPP3eo).

```{r}
print(paste("Number of days included in daily_steps: ",length(unique(daily_steps$ActivityDay))))
print(paste("Number of days included in daily_activity: ",length(unique(daily_activity$ActivityDate))))
print(paste("Number of days included in daily_intensities: ",length(unique(daily_intensities$ActivityDay))))
print(paste("Number of days included in daily_sleep: ",length(unique(daily_sleep$SleepDay))))
```


### 3.4 Data Limitations
Due to the nature of this data, there are a few factors to consider:

* The study only has 33 participants. For a more comprehensive assessment of wearable market trends, a larger study would have to be conducted. 
* The study takes place during a two-month period in Spring, 2016, and the time span of the data is 31 days from April 12th to May 12th. A more recent study over a larger portion of the year would produce more relevant data.
* The participants' location and demographic information are unknown. A study with this information would be far more informative for market studies.
* The participants' personal experiences are not captured in the data. Without input on whether the participants themselves feel that they are getting enough sleep and exercise, we can only rely on CDC recommended averages. These averages, while useful as a benchmark, cannot account for the natural diversity in people's health needs.
* Differences in the abilities of the participants is not documented. For more inclusive data, collecting information on preexisting health conditions would make the final results more inclusive and equitable.

In the context of this study, we will be able to get reliable data about fitness tracker use from this data set, but pairing it with supplementary data would make the results of the study far stronger. 

## 4. Process

### 4.1 Data Cleaning
For cleaning, the data was uploaded to Google Sheets. 77 Rows were identified having step counts of 0 in daily steps and daily activity, and were removed as days participants did not use the fitness trackers to prevent skewing the data. 3 duplicate rows were removed from daily sleep.
Each column was checked for outliers, and no suspicious numbers were found. Additionally, all data types were checked to ensure that there was no misplaced information.

The files were then saved as "dailyActivity_cleaned.csv," "dailySteps_cleaned.csv," "dailyIntensities_cleaned.csv," and "sleepDay_cleaned.csv" in the same folder as the raw data.

```{r downloading the cleaned files}
daily_activity <- read.csv("dailyActivity_cleaned.csv")
daily_steps <- read.csv("dailySteps_cleaned.csv")
daily_intensities <- read.csv("dailyIntensities_cleaned.csv")
daily_sleep <- read.csv("sleepDay_cleaned.csv")
```

## 5. Analyze

### 5.1 Data Manipulation
To get additional insights, the data was transformed to get a list of average steps, sleep, and activity levels across the entirety of the study, with counts of how often participants logged their progress.

In this example, participant step counts are grouped by ID, the average step count for each participant are fount, and then any zero values are removed to avoid skewing data. Additionally, the averages are sorted into categories by step count for making charts:

```{r processing step count data}
avg_steps_participant <- daily_steps %>%
  group_by(Id) %>%
  summarize(avg_steps = mean(StepTotal)) %>%
  filter(avg_steps > 0) %>%
  mutate(activity_type = cut(avg_steps,
                             breaks = c(0,5000,7500,10000,12500,18000),
                             labels = c("Sedentary \n(0-5K)",
                                        "Low Active \n(5-7.5K)", 
                                        "Somewhat Active \n(7.5 - 10K)", 
                                        "Active \n(10-12.5K)",
                                        "Highly Active \n(12.5K+)")))
head(avg_steps_participant)
```

For sleep data, the total minutes asleep were converted to hours, the , and then binning the data based on health recommendations was used for future chart making. Additionally, the difference between time in bed and total minutes asleep was calculated for further information on sleep data:

```{r sleep: group, summarize, bin}
avg_sleep_participant <- daily_sleep %>%
  summarize(sleep_hrs = TotalMinutesAsleep / 60,
            inBed_sleepAmount_diff_minutes = TotalTimeInBed - TotalMinutesAsleep) %>%
  mutate(sleep_amount = cut(sleep_hrs,
                            breaks = c(0, 6, 10, 24),
                            labels = c("Low Sleep \n(0-6 hrs)",
                                       "Average Sleep \n(6-10 hrs)",
                                       "High Sleep \n(10+ hrs)")))
head(avg_sleep_participant)
```

For workout intensities, a composite score is calculated by adding together all exercise minutes across days of the week.

```{r convert date to weekday}
#calculating intensities, and then finding the top days
daily_intensities$day <- wday(as.Date(daily_intensities$ActivityDay,
                                      '%m/%d/%Y'),
                              label = TRUE)

#create a summary table of day intensities by participant
avg_intensities_day_participant <- daily_intensities %>%
  group_by(Id, day) %>%
  summarize(active_minutes = mean(FairlyActiveMinutes) + mean(VeryActiveMinutes)) %>%
  arrange(Id,desc(active_minutes))

avg_intensities_day_participant$Id <-
  as.character(avg_intensities_day_participant$Id)

#ranking most active days
avg_inten_day_part_summary <- avg_intensities_day_participant %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarize(total_minutes = sum(active_minutes))
```

## 6. Share

### 6.1 Step Count Data

Now that the tables have been analyzed, we are able to visualize our findings. First, we used the step count data to group the participants by activity level:

```{r Visualizing step counts by category}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(avg_steps_participant) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = activity_type, fill = "#ff7935")) +
  labs(x = "Step Count",
       y = "Participants",
       title = "Step Counts by Participant",
       caption = "Activity Categories by www.10000steps.org.au") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        legend.position = "none",
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())
```

The visual shows that the highest number of participants have average step counts lower than 10,000. Most commonly, participants are "Somewhat Active" with averages ranging from 7,500 to 10,000 steps per day. There is a noticeable drop in the amount of participants who walk more than 10,000 steps.

### 6.2 Sleep Data

Participants are then grouped based on their sleep data:

```{r visualizing sleep hours by category}
ggplot(avg_sleep_participant) +
  geom_point(aes(y = sleep_hrs,
                x = inBed_sleepAmount_diff_minutes,
                color = sleep_amount)) +
  labs(x = "Minutes in Bed without Sleep",
       y = "Hours of Sleep",
       title = "Hours of Sleep vs. Minutes in Bed without Sleep") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "grey"))
```

This visual shows data comparing the number of hours of sleep participants had gotten against the amount of time that it takes participants to fall asleep. The data is color-coded based on the amount of sleep that participants were able to get, and shows that participants with lower levels of sleep spend more time in bed without sleeping. 

### 6.3 Daily Intensity Data

```{r create a bar chart for intensities}
ggplot(avg_inten_day_part_summary,
       aes(x = day, y = total_minutes)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.5, fill = "#ff7935") +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, 1300)) +
  labs(y = "Total Minutes of Active Time",
       x = "Day of the Week",
       title = "Active Times by Day of the Week") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "grey"))
```

The bar chart shows that Saturday is the most active day for the Fitbit users. Monday and Tuesday follow, and Thursday and Friday are the least common days for exercise. 

### 6.3 Data Recommendations

Fitness trackers have the potential to be a vital tool in sleep hygiene. There is a significant demographic of sleepers who get below average sleep and spend considerable amounts of time in bed trying to sleep. For Bellabeat's marketing of the Ivy fitness tracker, there is a potential to serve this demographic through the product's sleep tracking and mindfulness features.

In the case of daily activity, participants preferred Saturday and the early week for exercising. The Ivy has the potential to appeal to customers looking for weekend getaways and to fit more activity into a busy work-week. Specifically, the Ivy's built-in readiness score has the potential to better suggest workouts and wellness outings.

Marketing Campaigns:

* A focus on the wearable as a means to improve sleep quality. The Ivy is particularly suited to being a sleep coach due to the device's lack of screen and week-long battery life. Consider online ads selling the device as a means to unplug, rest, and recover.
* The Ivy's ability to blend in to a busy life make it the perfect health tracker for women with busy schedules who want to continue living active lifestyles. A marketing campaign centering how the Ivy fits perfectly for the professional who still finds time to exercise in the week, and leaves for the outdoors in the weekend would make good use of the wearable's strengths.

Potential software tweaks to coincide with marketing:

* Time sensitive mindfulness that reacts to a user's sleep patterns and suggests wind-down times to pair with mindfulness activities.
* Suggestions for activity to do in app when users are not able to fall asleep within thirty minutes of laying down for bed. This could coincide with an entirely new "sleep training" component of the wearable.
